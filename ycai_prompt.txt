### Finding Your Niche

**Why a Niche is Important**

Finding a good niche is crucial in business, especially in e-commerce. A niche is a targeted group of people with similar interests. The more refined your niche, the better, as it lowers competition. However, be careful not to narrow your niche too much. For example, instead of just "vegan recipes," you might offer a broader range like vegan health guides, meal planners, and more, maximizing your audience.

**Researching Your Niche**

Before selecting a niche, search for it on Etsy and assess the competition. Make sure there aren’t too many similar products already dominating the space. A semi-refined niche is often the best balance, offering manageable competition while still allowing you to create a substantial number of products.
